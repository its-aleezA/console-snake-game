# 🐍 Console Snake Game in C++

A console-based Snake game implemented in C++ using basic rendering and logic. It features score tracking, increasing tail length, food generation, wall collision, and difficulty selection. The game runs directly in the terminal using simple character-based graphics.

## 📖 Game Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic Snake game for the command line, written entirely in C++. The game uses `conio.h` and `windows.h` for rendering and input handling, making it compatible with Windows terminals.

- The player controls the snake using **WASD keys**
- Eating food (`#`) increases the tail length and score
- Collision with walls or the tail ends the game
- The player can choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty
